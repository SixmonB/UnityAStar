# UnityAStar
A Star implementation in Unity as a test code for Talespine. The AStar.cs and IAStarNode.cs files were provided by them as well as the textures and hexagon prefab, the rest was developed by me. The idea of the test was to implement a path finding algorithm to find the shortest way between 2 selected tiles, according to travelling costs depending on the correspondent terrain.
